Building the described SaaS project based on this multi-tenant implementation strategy involves several logical steps. Here's the recommended order of implementation:

---

### **1. Understand Requirements and Plan**
   - **Define the scope:** Clarify what the SaaS app will offer and how multitenancy will be applied.
   - **Identify tenants:** Understand the data and processes that will be tenant-specific.
   - **Choose tech stack:** Use MySQL as described, with a backend framework that supports this architecture (like Laravel).

---

### **2. Database Schema Design**
   - **Create base tables:** Design tables to include a `tenant_id` column in each table where multitenancy applies.
   - **Define constraints:** Ensure proper indexing on `tenant_id` for efficient querying.
   - **Design the view structure:**
     - Create updateable views for each base table.
     - Exclude the `tenant_id` from the views but include a `WHERE tenant_id = current_user()` clause.

---

### **3. Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Implement superuser login:** Develop a mechanism for an application-level superuser to create new tenants.
   - **Create tenant-specific users:** During tenant onboarding, generate a unique `tenant_id` and corresponding database user ID.
   - **Store user info:** Securely save tenant information (e.g., user ID, password) in a separate database or schema for added security.

---

### **4. Application Logic for Multi-Tenancy**
   - **Session management:** Modify the authentication process to determine and save the `tenant_id` for the current session.
   - **Dynamic connections:** Ensure that subsequent database connections during the session use the `tenant_id` as the connection user.

---

### **5. Triggers for `tenant_id` Population**
   - **Create insert triggers:** Write triggers for each base table to automatically populate the `tenant_id` column using the `current_user()` variable.
   - **Audit fields:** Enhance triggers to also populate `created_at`, `updated_at`, and other audit columns.

---

### **6. Grant and Restrict Database Access**
   - **Define roles and permissions:** Restrict each `tenant_id` user to only access rows where `tenant_id = current_user()`.
   - **Separate schemas:** Optionally, place tenant and superuser authentication data in separate schemas for enhanced security.

---

### **7. Application Code Updates**
   - **Replace table usage with views:** Ensure all application code interacts only with views, never directly with base tables.
   - **Centralize query logic:** Implement ORM or repository patterns to encapsulate database queries and enforce best practices.

---

### **8. Security Measures**
   - **Prevent SQL injection:** Sanitize all user inputs and queries.
   - **Strengthen superuser protection:** Remove superuser access from the application database entirely post-setup.

---

### **9. Testing**
   - **Functional testing:** Verify the applicationâ€™s ability to segregate data between tenants.
   - **Stress testing:** Simulate scenarios with hundreds or thousands of tenants to ensure scalability.
   - **Security testing:** Ensure SQL injection or unauthorized access cannot bypass tenant isolation.

---

### **10. Deployment**
   - **Automate tenant onboarding:** Build scripts to automate creating users, roles, and permissions.
   - **Monitor performance:** Set up monitoring tools to track database usage, especially for tenant-specific users.
   - **Document the process:** Provide internal documentation for maintenance and future scaling.

---

### **11. Maintenance and Scaling**
   - **Periodic audits:** Regularly check tenant isolation.
   - **Optimize indexes:** Based on usage patterns, adjust indexing and query plans for performance.
   - **Plan for backups:** Implement tenant-aware backup strategies for disaster recovery.

---

### **12. Enhancements**
   - **Add tenant-specific configurations:** For example, tenant-specific themes or settings.
   - **Improve triggers:** Add more robust audit data or optimize triggers for performance.
   - **Upgrade architecture:** Consider sharding or distributed databases if scaling requires it.

By following this logical order, you'll ensure a smooth development process and a robust multitenant SaaS architecture.

CREATE USER 'tenant1'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password1'; -- Tenant 1
CREATE USER 'tenant2'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password2'; -- Tenant 2
CREATE USER 'tenant3'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password3'; -- Tenant 3

Make Tenant as Customer

- each Customer would have it's own users.
- when a Customer is created - it would have it's own db_user & db_password to access the DB ( isolated ). 
- admin user is created along with Customer referenced by customer_id (here tenant_id)
